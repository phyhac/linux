# linux kernel mirror developed for research
Here are some patches when you compile and run the kernel in my reseach projects.

I will show them as seperate branches, and then you can checkout different kernel versions as you need.

## how to use
I prefer to git clone certain branch as below. You can check all of them in github web page or chech out the list below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phyhac/linux.git --branch <branch-name> --depth 1
```

When you just git clone it totally... 
Well, make sure network connectivity and good luck!
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phyhac/linux.git
git tag # checkout the branches as pattern <project>-<version>
git checkout <project>-<version> # switch to the tag as you need!
```

## branch list
- thuffle-v6.7
